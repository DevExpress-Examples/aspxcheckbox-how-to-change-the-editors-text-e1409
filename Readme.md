# ASPxCheckBox - How to change the editor's Text


<p>This example demonstrates how to use the client-side API to change an ASPxCheckBox's text on the client. Initially, the ASPxCheckBox has a null value, and the editor is displayed greyed. When the editor's state is changed, the editor's text changes its color. To change the editors text color, a specific HTML markup (in particular, a SPAN element) is used. This markup wraps the ASPxCheckBox's text.</p>
